## CryptoZombies DApp – Midterm Project

Welcome to the CryptoZombies DApp! This decentralized application (DApp) allows users to create and enhance their own zombie army and kitties, level them up through gameplay, and interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by the CryptoZombies platform, this project is built using Solidity, ReactJS, and Web3, with smart contracts deployed on the Sepolia testnet and Ganache for local development.

## Features and Enhancements

### 1. **Deployment on Sepolia Testnet**
   - The smart contracts have been deployed on the Sepolia testnet, allowing for real-world blockchain simulation and testing.

### 2. **Enhanced Website Design**
   - The user interface has been completely revamped for a more engaging and user-friendly experience.

### 3. **Custom Kitty Smart Contract**
   - A custom smart contract was developed using Ganache to generate and manage kitties within the DApp.

### 4. **ReactJS Front-End Migration**
   - The front-end has been migrated to ReactJS, making it more scalable and easier to maintain.

### 5. **User-Created Zombies with Custom Names**
   - Users can create zombies and assign unique custom names to each one.

### 6. **Dynamic Zombie Cards**
   - Zombie cards dynamically update based on the current user's account, adding personalization to the game.

### 7. **Auto-Generated Zombie Images**
   - Zombie images are automatically generated using [Robohash](https://robohash.org/) based on the zombie's name and ID.

### 8. **Zombie Creation Limit**
   - Each user can create up to six zombies, adding a layer of strategy to the game.

### 9. **MetaMask Integration**
   - Seamless integration with MetaMask via the Web3 API, allowing users to interact with smart contracts deployed on both Ganache (local blockchain) and Sepolia (testnet).
